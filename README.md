Day-72

Today's topic was MatPlotLib which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

used .groupby() to explore the number of posts and entries per programming language

converted strings to Datetime objects with to_datetime() for easier plotting

reshaped our DataFrame by converting categories to columns using .pivot()

used .count() and isna().values.any() to look for NaN values in our DataFrame, which we then replaced using .fillna()

created (multiple) line charts using .plot() with a for-loop

styled our charts by changing the size, the labels, and the upper and lower bounds of our axis.

added a legend to tell apart which line is which by colour

smoothed out our time-series observations with .rolling().mean() and plotted them to better identify trends over time.

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
